For MAC OS users
If you already have php in your system.

Go to the SSM directory on terminal
/usr/bin/php -S localhost:80
Start the app using Launcher.html

If not install php and perform the steps above

For Windows users.

You can use something like XAMPP.
Place the contents of the SSM folder in the htdocs folder in the xampp directory
and run launcher.html.

If there is a separate path you choose in the htdocs directory,
change the launcher.html file to point to that custom path.
